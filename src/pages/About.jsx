                                Journey of Care was born from a simple yet profound realization: that the best care 
                                happens when people can remain in the place they love most - their home. Our founder, 
                                Sarah Johnson, witnessed firsthand the challenges families face when trying to provide 
                                quality care for their loved ones while maintaining their independence and dignity.
